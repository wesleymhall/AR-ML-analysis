# AR-Trend-Segmentation-Analysis

Accounts Receivable Trend & Segmentation Analysis

Tools: Python | Jupyter Notebook | Machine Learning (KMeans, Linear Regression)

This project explores customer payment behavior and portfolio optimization by analyzing Accounts Receivable (AR) and profitability data. The goal is to provide actionable insights for management, highlighting high-value customers and identifying potential collection risks.

Features

Data Evaluation: Examined AR and profitability datasets to uncover patterns in customer payment behavior.

Data Preparation: Cleaned and transformed raw data for machine learning analysis.

Customer Segmentation: Applied KMeans clustering to group customers by value and payment behavior.

Trend Modeling: Used linear regression to model payment trends and detect signals of potential collection risks.

Objectives

Identify which customers contribute the most value to the organization.

Highlight customers that may require strategic reconsideration or closer monitoring.

Demonstrate how machine learning can enhance traditional financial analytics.
